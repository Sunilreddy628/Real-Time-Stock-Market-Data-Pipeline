## 🔧 Setup Instructions  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-stock-pipeline.git
cd real-time-stock-pipeline

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Start Kafka Cluster

docker-compose up -d

4️⃣ Run Kafka Producer (Stock Price Ingestion)

python stock_price_producer.py

5️⃣ Start Apache Flink for Stream Processing

./flink/bin/start-cluster.sh
flink run -c StockStreamProcessor target/stock-pipeline.jar

6️⃣ Launch Airflow for ETL Automation

airflow standalone

7️⃣ Connect to Power BI Dashboard

Import the Power BI template (.pbix)

Connect to Delta Lake storage

Start analyzing live stock trends

📊 Data Flow

1️⃣ Kafka Producer fetches real-time stock prices from API and streams to Kafka topics.
2️⃣ Apache Flink processes the data, detecting anomalies and aggregating trends.
3️⃣ Delta Lake stores both real-time and batch-processed data for further analysis.
4️⃣ Airflow DAGs orchestrate ETL jobs for periodic data transformation.
5️⃣ Power BI visualizes trends and alerts traders for critical stock movements.

🏆 Key Optimizations

🔹 High-throughput streaming using Kafka partitions
🔹 Low-latency processing with Flink event time windowing
🔹 Efficient storage with Delta Lake’s ACID transactions
🔹 Parallelized ETL workflows managed in Apache Airflow
